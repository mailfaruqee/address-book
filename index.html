      <p>
        Welcome to GeoContacts, the personalized address book with a
        geographical enhancement. In this application, the classic structure of
        an address book has been enriched with dynamic mapping capabilities.
        Itâ€™s no longer just about keeping contact details; now, the locations of
        friends are also pinpointed and visualized on an interactive map. This
        integration of contact information with geospatial data provides a
        comprehensive and connected overview of one's social network.
